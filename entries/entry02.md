I started learning Kaboom by learning how to add a player by using the `sprite()` function. I also learned different components, such as adding position, health and color by reading about each component on the Kaboom website. Then, I tried applying and tinkering with it to see what changes it will cause.

My FP goal for the winter break is to watch videos and tinker with other components. I plan to start learning how I can add movement and make the sprite move.

I am currently at Stage 2: Research the problem of the Engineering Design Process. In this stage, I am currently learning my tool and finding ways that I can use to create a game. For the next stage, I will continue to tinker with my tool.

One skill that I grew in is how to read because I had to read about the different components and understand how I could apply it to my example. I realized that it could be confusing after the first read, but later on, I found that trying out the code was extremely helpful. Another skill that I grew in is organization because I found that organizing was very helpful for me. I realized that keeping track of which part I learned saved time and made it less confusing for me, when I wanted to refer back and figure out changes each component did, after tinkering with those concepts.
