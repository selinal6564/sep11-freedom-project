I started to learn how to add movement to the sprite in Kaboom. One way that I learned to add movement is to make the sprite jump when "space" was pressed. I learned that `.jump()` was used to make the spirte jump and that `.grounded()` was also needed for the sprite to stay on platform so it was ready to jump. Another thing that I learned was how to add obstacles for the sprite to jump over. Something new that I learned from this was that I could use `loop()` to add multiple obstacles of the same one.

Next, I plan to learn how to make the sprite move left and right and how a score can be added to the game.

I am currently at Stage 2: Research the problem of the Engineering Design Process. In this stage, I am learning my tool and figuring out how a game can be made using Kaboom. For the next stage, I plan on tinkering with my tool more and start thinking about what I will use to make the game.
