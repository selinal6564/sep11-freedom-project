I started to learn how to add movement to the sprite in Kaboom. One way that I learned to add movement is to make the sprite jump when "space" was pressed. I learned that I needed to use `.jump()` to make it work, however I also learned that I needed `.grounded()` to make sure that it was on the platform ready to jump. Another thing that I learned was how to add obstacles for the sprite to jump over. Something new that I learned from this was that I use `loop()` to add multiple obstacles of the same one.

Next, I plan how learning how to make the sprite move left and right and how a score can be added to the game.
