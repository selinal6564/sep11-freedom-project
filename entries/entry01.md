# Choosing My Tool
##### 11/7/22

For my tool, I chose Kaboom because I found that it would be helpful to create a game, while I was tinkering with it. Kaboom was also my first choice for a tool and I found that it would be interesting to learn, while I was tinkering and trying out the different components to see what it would do. With Kaboom, I am planning to create a platformer game because I think it will be fun to create one and it's fun to play.

Throughout my process of deciding a tool, I had a few in mind and had to consider them. Since I wanted to create a game, I needed to find a tool that would best help me to do this. Tools that I have considered include: [Kaboom](https://kaboomjs.com/), [Phraser](https://phaser.io/) and [Melon](https://melonjs.org/). I considered these tools because I found that these would be helpful for creating games.

I am currently at **Stage 1: Define the problem of the Engineering Design Process**. In this stage, I am currently deciding on what I would like to make with coding and what tool would be best for that. For the next stage, I will start tinkering with my tool more.

One skill that I grew in is **organization** because I had to organize and keep track of what I was tinkering with and what I learned from that. Another skill that I grew in is **consideration** because I had to consider what I wanted to make, but also consider how and what tool I was going to use.
