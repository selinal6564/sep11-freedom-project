# Entry 6
##### 5/25/23

After we finished our projects, we had to give two presentations. One of them was an elevator pitch that we had to give at the SEP Expo. Takeaways that I had from the elevator pitch were to be more prepared before the Expo and to be more confidence. I learned that practicing and preparing more before the Expo was important because it gives you more time to plan. While preparing for the Expo, I felt a little rushed because I felt that I could have explained the process of making the game more clearly and I wasn't able to explain challenges that we encountered during the project. I also learned that it's important to be confidence.
